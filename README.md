# Project SMAS â€” Demo Frontend (localStorage)

This is a quick demo frontend for Project SMAS. It uses React + Vite and stores users/exams in localStorage so you can demo auth, exam creation, and a dashboard without a backend.

## Run locally
npm install
npm run dev

## Build
npm run build

## Notes
- Auth is local (not secure). Use only for demos.
- To reset demo data, clear localStorage in your browser.
